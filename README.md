# coOccurance_DessertLabsPBC_CodingChallenge

1. Read the file and store all the words in a list
2. Iterate through the list of words as the outer loop and use another
iteration which is nested , that runs over the range obtained as an
input.
3. For every word Store the values in a temporary dictionary of size
2K to avoid the repetition.
4. Update the main dictionary by increment the count when necessary
5. This dictionary contains the co-occurance
6. For every iteration in the outer loop calculate the count of word
by storing it in a dictionary
7.Get the 2 words as a space separated input from the user.
8. The probability is calculated using the formula in the document and
is printed
9. If the word does not exist "0.00" is printed.
10. K is tested to be in bounds ( 1 to 5) inclusive
